# dotfiles
various dotfile configs for i3wm &amp; xfce

<b>t</b>he /home directory files should be placed in your respective home user folder (e.g. `/home/username/`)<br>
-there is a crude install script to force-copy all configs to the correct locations<br>
-(only tested locally on Ubuntu 16.04.3)

-to run the script, clone this repo and make it executable:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/commonroutes/dotfiles`<br>
`cd dotfiles`<br>
`chmod +x install.sh`<br>
`./install.sh`<br>

<b>t</b>hese configs will assume the arc-dark theme and many third-party applications<br>
-comb through and make changes according to your preferences and/or applications<br>

<b>t</b>he compton config is currently a copy/paste job from [duncanlock](http://duncanlock.net/blog/2013/06/07/how-to-switch-to-compton-for-beautiful-tear-free-compositing-in-xfce/)<br>
-comments will eventually be tidied up, but the core configs will likely remain the same
