# dotfiles
various dotfile configs for i3wm &amp; xfce

the /home directory files should be placed in your respective home user folder (e.g. `/home/username/`)<br>
-there will be a script written for this... eventually.

my configs will assume the arc-dark theme and many third-party applications<br>
-comb through and make changes according to your preferences and/or applications<br>

my compton config is currently a copy/paste job from [duncanlock](http://duncanlock.net/blog/2013/06/07/how-to-switch-to-compton-for-beautiful-tear-free-compositing-in-xfce/)<br>
-comments will eventually be tidied up, but the core configs will likely remain the same
